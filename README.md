# KobeřiceLisp

### Language compiled to Common Lisp

###### It's absolutely useless

---

KobeřiceLisp is literally Common Lisp compiled to Common Lisp... Well, with a few differences. 

* Programs written in KobericeLisp have to start and end with a call to function (Kobeřice).
* Instead of using (terpri), you use (opli-mas-oplatek) in KobeřiceLisp.

KobeřiceLisp uses .klisp file extension.

---

Don't define functions (terpri) and (Kobeřice), the compiler won't let you do it anyway. 

---

Use ( (load), (compile-file), (require) ) to import Common Lisp files.

There is no KobeřiceLisp way to import KobeřiceLisp files, but the Common Lisp functions might work.
