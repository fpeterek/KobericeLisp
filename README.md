# KobeřiceLisp

Language compiled to Common Lisp

---

KobeřiceLisp is literally Common Lisp compiled to Common Lisp. Well, with a few differences. 

Programs written in KobericeLisp have to start and end with a call to function (Kobeřice).
Instead of using (terpri), you use (opli-mas-oplatek) in KobeřiceLisp.

---

Don't define functions (terpri) and (Kobeřice), the compiler won't let you do it anyway.
